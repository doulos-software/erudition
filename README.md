The pursuit of theological information science.


## Premise
To computer nerds _zero_ is the first number, _one_ is the second, et cetera...
The number of atoms in the world exceeds the amount of information every produced by mankind by nearly 6 orders of magnitude...

The fact that two independent, autonomous beings can communicate depends on information, which depends on an epistemic system.
In short: knowledge depends on prior knowledge, and transfer of knowledge depends on a transmission medium (the system).

As the root of all things we must somehow collide with issues pertaining to truth and it's origin.

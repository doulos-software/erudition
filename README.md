The pursuit of theological information science.


## Premise
To computer nerds _zero_ is the first number, _one_ is the second, et cetera...
The number of atoms in the world exceeds the amount of information every produced by mankind by nearly 6 orders of magnitude...
Explanations of the origin of biological life, or even spiritual life, means nothing because it does not explain the origin of the information necessary to form that life...

These thoughts are presented to stimulate the mind toward the profound nature of information.
The fact that two independent, autonomous beings can communicate depends on information, which depends on an organon - a system which makes information possible and meaningful.


## Goals
This repository is intended to provide links to scholarly, factual information to help explore topics.
In addition we hope to provide study materials aimed at cultivating an understanding of information in a theological context.
It is hoped that these materials will facilitate discussions and explorations of information science and the ramifications of it.


## Topics
- Information
- Ontology
- Philology
- Diessemenation
- Colophon (the creators emblem)
- Rebellion (changing sides)
